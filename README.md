## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

This project is best run on **Google Colab** (free GPU provided).

### Quick Steps:
1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Upload your input image(s).
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install diffusers transformers accelerate scipy safetensors
    ```
4. Load the Waifu Diffusion model.
5. Enter your creative prompt and run the generation cell.
6. Save and download your output!

> **Note:**  
> Make sure you have a stable internet connection while running the model, as it requires downloading weights and running computations on GPU.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Can you explain the code cell-by-cell?

Yes!  
The project is divided into simple cells, each performing a specific task:

| Step | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Install necessary Python libraries |
| 2 | Import libraries (Diffusers, PIL, etc.) |
| 3 | Load the Waifu Diffusion model into memory |
| 4 | Define input and output image paths |
| 5 | Load your input image and resize it |
| 6 | Define your artistic prompt |
| 7 | Generate the new Ghibli-style image |
| 8 | Save and display the output |

Every step is modular, so you can run them separately without repeating heavy downloads.

If you need a **detailed, deep explanation cell-by-cell**, feel free to check the code comments inside the notebook or contact me!
